How to become a Turing student

1. Investigate potential schools
    1. Google programming schools
        1. Open your browser
        2. Go to "Google.com"
        3. Search "Programming schools"
        4. Write down names of several schools from results
            1. Google search the first school you wrote down
            2. Read reviews of that school
            3. Write down a summary score for that school
            4. Repeat sub-steps 1.i.a.a through 1.i.a.c for each school you wrote down
    2. Choose a school
        1. Look at your list of school review scores
        2. Determine which school you scored highest
        3. Realize it's Turing, of course!
2. Apply to Turing
    1. Attend Turing's "Try Coding" weekend
        1. Go to [turing.io/try-coding/](https://turing.io/try-coding/)
        2. Click "Join Event" to participate in the next available event

        5. Be impressed and decide to apply
    2. Complete an online application
        1. Go to Turing.io
        2. Click on "Programs"
        3. Determine if you are interested in Front End or Back End
            1. Google the terms "front end" and "back end"
            2. Think over what you've learned
            3. Ultimately make a choice between "front end" or "back end" and stick with it

            3. Click "Authorize"
        7. Fill out the Intake Survey
        8. Complete a logic exam
    3. Schedule an interview
        1. Once contacted, determine a time when you can travel to Turing for an in-person interview
        2. Schedule an interview with your Turing contact for the time you determined in the last step.
3. Interview at Turing
    1. Get directions to Turing
        1. Type in Turing's address into Google Maps
    2. Travel to Turing
        1. Follow the Google Maps directions to Turing
    3. Interview with your contact person
        1. Don't get nervous
        2. Answer all questions
4. Complete Mod 0
    1. Attend Mod 0 session 1
    2. Complete Mod 0 session 1 homework
    3. Attend Mod 0 session 2
    4. Complete Mod 0 session 2 homework
    5. Attend Mod 0 session 3
    6. Complete Mod 0 session 3 homework
    7. Attend Mod 0 session 4
    8. Complete Mod 0 session 4 homework
    9. Attend Mod 0 session 5
    10. Complete Mod 0 Technical Assessment
    11. Attend Mod 0 session 6
    12. Complete Mod 0 Capstone
    13. Practice what you've learned until your cohort start date
5. Arrive at Turing on your start date
    1. Leave early
    2. Travel to Turing
    3. Arrive early

Note to instructors: I wasn't sure if we were supposed to do this in the same notation we learned in class, or in markdown notation since this is a markdown file.

Also, toward the end things aren't quite as detailed since I think I might be over my time limit on this and I want to be sure I complete the rest of the assessment in time.
